# Problem Name

2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations

---

## Problem Statement
Given an array of any operations from ["--X","X--","++X","X++"] as input you are supposed to increment or decrement the initial integer 0 and give the final value after performing all the operations.

---

## Approach
1. Loop through the array and check the middle character of the string.
2. If the character is *+* incrememnt the count else decrement.
3. Return the final output after all the operations have been performed.

---

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {
        int count = 0;
        for(string op : operations)
        {
            if(op[1]=='+'){
                count++;
            }
            else{
                count--;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
