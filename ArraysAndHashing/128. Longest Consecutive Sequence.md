# Problem Name

128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

---

## Problem Statement
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

---

## Approach
1. Insert all elements of the array into an unordered set for O(1) lookups.
2. Iterate through the set and identify the start of each consecutive sequence (a number whose previous number is not present in the set).
3.For each start, keep checking the next consecutive numbers until the sequence 4.breaks, counting the length.
Keep track of the maximum length found and return it.

---

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        unordered_set<int> numSet(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int longest = 0;
        for (int num : numSet) {
            if (!numSet.count(num - 1)) {
                int current = num;
                int streak = 1;
                while (numSet.count(current + 1)) {
                    current++;
                    streak++;
                }
                longest = max(longest, streak);
            }
        }
        return longest;
    }
};
