# Problem Name

238. Product of Array Except Self

---

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time and without using the division operation.

---

## Approach
1. Use a prefix pass to store the product of all elements before the current index.
2. Use a suffix pass to multiply each position by the product of all elements after the index.
3. Avoid using division to handle cases with zeros.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> answer(n, 1);
        int prefix = 1, suffix = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            answer[i] = prefix;
            prefix *= nums[i];
        }
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            answer[i] *= suffix;
            suffix *= nums[i];
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
