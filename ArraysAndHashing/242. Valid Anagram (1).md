# Problem Name

242. Valid Anagram

---

## Problem Statement
Given two strings you have to check them for anagram and return a boolean value accordingly.

---

## Approach
1. In this solution I used a method called counting array.
2. First check the length of both the strings, if they do not match return false.
3. If they match construct an array of 26 elements and initialize them with zeroes.
4. For every same character encountered while iterating through both the strings incremenent the character index of string a and decrement the character index of string b.
5. This way the anagram strings will give an array of zeroes otherwise you will encounter a count other than zero.
6. Iterate the counting array and return false if any of the element is non-zero.
7. Otherswise return true.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        if(s.length() != t.length()) return false;

        int count[26] = {0};

        for(int i=0;i<t.size();++i){
            count[s[i]-'a']++;
            count[t[i]-'a']--;
        }

        for(int c: count){
            if(c!=0)return false;
        }
        return true;
        
    }
};
