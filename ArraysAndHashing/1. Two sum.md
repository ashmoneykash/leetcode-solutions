# Problem Name

1. Two sum

---

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers *nums* and an integer *target*, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target. Keep in check that there is only one suitable pair of solution and you may not use the same element twice.

---

## Approach
1. Iterate through the array *nums* and using nested loop check for the target sum for each element.
2. Return the pair of indices that satisfy the target sum condition.
3. Return empty pair if target sum is not satisfied.

---

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<nums.size();j++){
                if((nums[i]+nums[j])==target) return {i,j};
            }
        }
    }
};
