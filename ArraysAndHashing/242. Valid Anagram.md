# Problem Name

242. Valid Anagram

---

## Problem Statement
Given two strings you have to check them for anagram and return a boolean value accordingly.

---

## Approach
1. Check for the lengths of the two strings.
2. If the lengths dont match they cannot be anagram, thus we return false.
3. If the lengths match sort them and compare them using a comparison operator to determine if they are anagram or not.

---

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        if(s.length() != t.length()){
            return false;
        }

        sort(s.begin(),s.end());
        sort(t.begin(),t.end());
        return s==t;
    }
};
