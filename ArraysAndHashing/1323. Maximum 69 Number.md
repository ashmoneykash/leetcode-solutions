# Problem Name

1323. Maximum 69 Number

---

## Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9.

Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).

---

## Approach
1. Change the number to a string s using to_string() function.
2. Iterate through the string using call by reference and change the first 6 encountered to 9 as it will give the greatest number.
3. Return the stoi(num) to give int as result instead of the string.

---

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximum69Number (int num) {
        string s = to_string(num);

        for(char &c : s){
            if(c=='6'){
                c = '9';
                break;
            }
        }

        return stoi(s);
    }
};
